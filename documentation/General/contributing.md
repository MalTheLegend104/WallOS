# Contribution Guide
This document hopes to clarify the contribution process, and hopefully make it easy to contribute to the project.

## Table of Contents

## Prerequisites
- Follow the [setup & building guide](setup_and_build.md).
- Read the [code style guide](code-style.md).
- Read the [documentation guide](documentation.md).

## Personal Forks
All code contributions should ideally come from a personal fork. 
This is in an attempt to keep this main repository clean, and avoids cluttering the project with many unnecessary commits.

If you are actively working on something from a GitHub issue or discussion, comment to avoid multiple people working on the same thing.

## Pull Requests

> The rest of this page is a work in progress. Just be respectful with pull requests. There will eventually be a contributor agreement, along with a few guidelines for approvals and denials.
